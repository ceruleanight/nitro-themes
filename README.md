# Nitro Themes

Use a discord mod such as Vencord or BetterDiscord to apply these themes.

## Instructions

1. Add the base. Without this, the themes will not work.

For example, add the dark theme base:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceruleanight/nitro-themes/main/base/dark.theme.css
```

2. Pick which theme you want.

For example, the Midght Burple Theme:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceruleanight/nitro-themes/main/themes/midnight_burple.theme.css
```

3. If you want any available custom edits, you essentially do the same as above.

Example of Midnight Burple theme with useless buttons removed and my own custom edits to the theme:
```

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceruleanight/nitro-themes/main/themes/midnight_burple.theme.css
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceruleanight/nitro-themes/main/custom/midnight_burple_improvements.theme.css
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceruleanight/nitro-themes/main/custom/remove_useless_buttons.theme.css
```
